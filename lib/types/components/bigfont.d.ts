 * the wordmark shimmer — see the `stepMs` parameter). Glyphs are 5 columns wide so curves
 * and diagonals stay legible; only the letters the tagline needs are
 * defined, and unknown characters fall back to a hollow box so a typo
 * fails visibly instead of crashing the splash.

 * `flash` travels left to right (one column per `stepMs`, matching the
 * wordmark shimmer's cadence). Returns 5 ANSI rows.
